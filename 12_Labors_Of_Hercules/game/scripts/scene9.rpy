    centaur_father 'Hercules, we share our story with heavy hearts. A few days ago, our beloved daughter was abducted by bandits who hold deep-seated hatred towards centaurs.'
    
    hercules 'Tell me, noble centaurs, who is responsible for this heinous act?'
    
    centaur_mother 'The leader of these bandits is Isidore. He despises centaurs and delights in tormenting our little one. He keeps her imprisoned in a cruel cage, subjecting her to endless mockery. The bastards have established their camp in the treacherous Wailing Woods, to the east of the Great River.'
    
    hercules 'This injustice shall not stand. I swear upon my name and the gods who guide me that I shall rescue your daughter from the clutches of Isidore.'
    
    centaur_father "Hercules, your words bring solace to our wounded hearts. Our daughter's innocence must be preserved. Please, save her from this plight."
    
    hercules 'I give you my word, noble centaurs. I shall confront Isidore, release your daughter from her cage, and bring an end to his reign of hatred.'
    
    centaur_mother "May the gods guide you, Hercules. Our daughter's life rests in your hands. Return her to us, and our gratitude shall know no bounds."
    
    hercules 'I shall not fail you. The bond we have forged shall strengthen my resolve. Trust in my abilities, for I will bring your daughter back to your loving embrace.'
