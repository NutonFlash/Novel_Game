    hercules 'Iliot! It warms my heart to see you again after all these years. May I join you?'

    iliot 'Hercules! Of course, my friend. It\'s been far too long. Sit, sit!'

    hercules 'Ah, the memories flood back, don\'t they? The battles we fought, the triumphs we celebrated. Those were truly remarkable times.'

    iliot 'Indeed, my friend. The victories, the camaraderie... There was a sense of invincibility when we stood together.'

    hercules 'To those days and the bond we forged. No challenge was too great when we fought side by side.'

    iliot 'To the memories, Hercules. They will forever remain etched in my heart.'

    hercules 'Iliot, I have been tasked with a great challenge - to slay the Hydra. I would be honored if you joined me once more, to face this danger together.'
