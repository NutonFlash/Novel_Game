    hercules 'Isidore, leader of these bandits, I have come with a proposition. You have two options before you. Release the centaur girl you have captured, tell me where to find the Hydra, and abandon this forest forever or... Die.'

    isidore 'Ha! You think I\'d bow down to your demands, Hercules? We\'ve faced death countless times. We fear nothing, least of all you! We choose option two!'

    hercules 'So be it. If you choose to fight, then prepare for a battle like none you have ever faced. I will not hold back, and the consequences of your decision will rest upon your shoulders.'

    bandits '"some showing signs of hesitation while others revel in the prospect of battle, their loyalty to Isidore binding them together"'

    hercules 'Know this, Isidore, your path leads to ruin and destruction. I offer you a chance to change, to embrace a different future. But if it is battle you seek, then battle you shall have!'

    isidore 'Enough talk, Hercules! Let the strongest prevail, and may the gods judge us all!'

    hercules 'Prepare to face the consequences of your choices.'
