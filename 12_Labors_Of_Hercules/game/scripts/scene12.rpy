    'Hercules, accompanied by the young centaur, stands before Isidore and his bandits. Tension fills the air as Hercules presents the same two options, seeking a peaceful resolution.'

    hercules 'Isidore, leader of these bandits, I have come with a proposition. You have two options before you.'
    hercules 'Option one: release the centaur girl you have captured, tell me where to find the Hydra, and abandon this forest forever or... Die.'

    isidore 'Ha! You think I\'d bow down to your demands, Hercules? We\'ve faced death countless times. We fear nothing, least of all you! We choose option two!'

    hercules 'So be it. If you choose to fight, then prepare for a battle like none you have ever faced. I will not hold back, and the consequences of your decision will rest upon your shoulders.'

    bandits '"some showing signs of hesitation while others revel in the prospect of battle, their loyalty to Isidore binding them together"'

    young_centaur 'Please, Isidore, choose the path of peace. Release my sister and end this violence. There\'s still time to change.'

    bandits 'Enough of this! I\'ll end it right now! The bandit releases an arrow, striking the young centaur and ending his life'

    hercules 'No! You\'ve sealed your fate, Isidore. Your actions will not go unpunished!'

    'The atmosphere erupts into chaos as battle cries fill the air, weapons clash, and the fight between Hercules and the bandits begins'
