    hercules 'Isidore, you are the last remaining obstacle in my path. Tell me where to find the Hydra, and perhaps there is still a chance for your survival.'

    isidore 'Hercules, spare my life, and I will tell you what you seek. The Hydra dwells deep within the treacherous swamps, hidden amidst the tangled roots and murky waters.'

    hercules 'Speak, Isidore. What are the landmarks or indications that can guide me to the Hydra\'s lair?'

    isidore 'Beyond the twisted willow trees, there lies a path known only to the swamp dwellers. Follow the eerie calls of the swamp creatures, for they lead to the Hydra\'s domain.'
    
    isidore 'Be cautious of the toxic mists that shroud the area, and the treacherous bog that threatens to swallow the unwary.'

            hercules 'Isidore, your life rests on the mercy of the gods and the consequences of your past deeds. Leave, and may you find redemption in a life far from these shadows.'

            isidore 'Thank you, Hercules. I will vanish into the depths of these lands, never to be seen again. You have my word.'

            isidore 'I won\'t forget this, Hercules. You won\'t see me again. Farewell.'

            isidore 'Please, Hercules, spare me. I have told you what you seek. Let me go, and I will disappear from these lands forever.'

            hercules 'Your fate has been sealed by your actions, Isidore. Your crimes end here.'

            isidore 'No! Please...'

    'Hercules turns to the captive centaur girl, his voice gentle yet firm'

    hercules 'You are free now. Return to your family, and may they find solace in your safe return.'

    'Her eyes wide with gratitude, she nods and runs off towards her waiting family, her heart filled with newfound hope.'

    'Hercules watches as the centaur girl disappears into the distance, his gaze turning towards the treacherous path that leads to the Hydra\'s lair'

    hercules 'The Hydra awaits, and with it, the completion of my labor. I will face this challenge and emerge victorious, for the sake of all who depend on me.'
